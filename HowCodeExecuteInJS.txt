1. Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language

2. It can execute only ONE line of code at a time.

3. Execution Context has two comnponents

    a. Memory comnponent
    b. Code Component

4. There are two phases 

    a. Memory Creation phases
    b. Execution Phase

Example:-

Line 1      let val1 = 10  
Line 2      let val2 = 20

Line 3      function addNum(num1,num2){
Line 4      let total = num1 + num2
Line 5      return total
            }

Line 6      let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
Line 7      let result2 = addNum(2,3)




Step 1 - Global Environment will be created
         It will be assigned to "THIS" 

Step 2 - Memory Phase
         Memory will be assigned to variable
         val1 -> undefined
         val2 -> undefined
         addNum -> full function definition
         result1 -> undefined
         result2 -> undefined

Step 3 - Execution Phase
         Values will be assigned as per code
         val1 -> 10
         val2 -> 20

         When the execution will come to Line 3 
         It is a function so new execution context will be created

                a - Memory Phase
                    val1 -> undefined
                    val2 -> undefined
                    total -> undefined

                b - Execution Phase
                    nums1 -> 10
                    nums2 -> 20
                    total -> 15

        Note:- After the execution context is executed it is "deleted".
        We will come back to our original execution context.
